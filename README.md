# RouteLinkKit

A lightweight iOS mini framework that enables programmatic navigation with SwiftUI. 
RouteLinkKit is fully compatible with native NavigationLinks, while also supporting features available when using UINavigationController.

## ‚è± Version History

| Version | Changes                  |
|---------|--------------------------|
| 0.8     | Pre-release.             |


## üõ† Features

RouteLinkKit has the following features:
* Supports vanilla SwiftUI lifecycle apps.
* Supports native NavigationLinks and state driven navigation.
* Supports mixing declarative and programmatic (imperative) navigation schemes.
* Uses UIKit based navigation, and exposes the navigation controller in use.

**Limitations:**
* Supports stacked navigation only. Not compatible with SwiftUI automatic sidebar and master-detail navigation configuration.
* Uses UIKit based navigation, which limits any products to work only on platforms that support UIKit.
* Minor set up and configuration may be required.
* All routes managed by a specific router must be of the same base type.
* Limited testing capability due to the fact that internally it uses native NavigationLink views.

### ‚ùóÔ∏èDisclaimer

This mini framework started as a proof of concept, and has only been tested with iOS and iPadOS, using the SwiftUI App lifecycle.
As a result, it is provided as is and without ANY warranty of any kind.
If you plan to use this framework, especially in producion code, please do a round of testing before commiting to it.


## üì¶ Instalation

### Swift Package

You may add RouteLinkKit as a Swift Package dependency using Xcode 11.0 or later, by selecting `File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency...` or `File > Add packages...` in Xcode 13.0 and later, and adding the url below:

`https://github.com/athankefalas/RouteLinkKit.git`

### Manually 

You may also install this framework manually by downloading the `RouteLinkKit` project and including it in your project.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Setup

This section will contain an example setup, for a app that displays a list of products and their details.

### 1. Define a set of Routes

A route is a type that can represent the routes available in a specific navigation hierarchy. Each route must be uniquely identifiable by it's hash value.
To define a route you can create an `enum`, `struct` or `class` and conform to the `RouteRepresenting` protocol. In the context of the test products app we may define the available routes as the `enum` below:


```swift
enum ProductRoutes: RouteRepresenting {
    case productsList
    case selectedProduct(productId: Int)
    case viewingProductDescription(productId: Int)
}
```


### 2. Define a ViewComposer

A view composer is a type that accepts a route and composes a view to visually represent that specific route. The view composer must know how to compose and create new views for each of the routes it supports. To define a view composer create a `class` and conform to the `ViewComposer` protocol. The only requirement of the protocol is to define a function that accpets a generic route and returns a type-erased view. If you want to dynamically compose views at runtime based onthe current context of your app you may do it in the view composer.


```swift
class ProductsViewComposer: ViewComposer {
    
    func composeView<Route>(for route: Route) -> AnyView where Route : RouteRepresenting {
        guard let productsRoute = route as? ProductRoutes else {
            assertionFailure("ProductsViewComposer: Failed to compose a view for route '\(route)' of type '\(type(of: route))'.")
            return AnyView( EmptyView() )
        }
        
        switch route {
        case .productsList:
            return AnyView( ProductsView() )
        case .selectedProduct(productId: let productId):
            return AnyView( ProductDetailsView(productId: productId) )
        case .viewingProductDescription(productId: let productId):
            return AnyView( ProductDescriptionView(productId: productId) )
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Create a router

A router is a type that can be used to manage and perform programmatic navigation. The router holds a reference to the UIKit navigation controller that is currently in use and the view composer for the navigation hierarchy it manages. Finally, a router also contains a property that defines it's root route. The type of the root route is assumed to be the base type used for all routes in the navigation hierarchy and must conform to the `RouteRepresenting` route.


``` swift
class ProductsRouter: Router {
    let navigationController = UIRoutingNavigationController()
    let routeViewComposer: ViewComposer = ProductsViewComposer()
    
    let rootRoute = ProductRoutes.productsList
}
```

#### 3.1 Injecting Routers in Views

The router is also injected in the environment values of all views that are descendants of a `RoutedNavigationView` and can be used in the following way:


```swift

struct SomeView: View {

    @Environment(\.routing) var routing: RoutingEnvironment

    var body: some View { ..... }

    func popToRoot() {
        // Use common methods
        routing.router?.dismissToRoot(animated: true)
    }
    
    func showTrail() {
        guard let router = routing.router as? ProductsRouter else {
            return
        }
        
        // Use common Route-dependant methods
        routing.router?.dismiss(to: .productsList)
        routing.router?.show(route: .productsList, animated: false)
        routing.router?.show(trail: [.productsList, .selectedProduct(productId:0), .viewingProductDescription(productId:0)])
    }

    func showTrailCustom() {
        // Drop down to UIKit to provide more custom functionality
        routing.router?.navigationController.setViewControllers([...], animated: true)
    }
}

```

#### 3.2 Router API

As mentioned above routers came with common navigation functions built-in, even though you can still provide your own by extensions or by using the navigation controller instance if needed. The functions that are already implemented in routers are the following:

|                   Function                   |                       Description                     |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| dismiss(animated: Bool)                      | Dismiss the top view in the current navigation stack. |
| dismissToRoot(animated: Bool)                | Dismiss all the views in the current navigation stack, until reaching the root view. |
| dismiss(to route: Route, animated: Bool)     | Dismiss the top views in the current navigation stack, until reaching the first instance of the specified route. |
| dismiss(before route: Route, animated: Bool) | Dismiss the top views in the current navigation stack, until reaching the view just before the specified route. |
| restart(animated: Bool)                      | Restart the current navigation stack by destroying all views, and restarts with a new instance of the root view.| 
| show(route: Route, animated: Bool)           | Shows a new view for the specified route at the top of the current navigation stack. |
| present(route: Route, animated: Bool)        | Presents a new view modally for the specified route at the top of the current navigation stack.|
| show(trail path: [Route], animated: Bool)    | Shows a new trail of routes, replacing the current navigation stack. |



### 4. Replace NavigationView with RoutedNavigationView 

One of the two SwiftUI components of RouteLinkKit is `RoutedNavigationView` that simply replaces the native NavigationView
with a custom implementation that uses a `UINavigationController` subclass for navigation and to provide the navigation bar.
The `RoutedNavigationView` behaves the same as the native `NavigationView` and can even perform native navigation links if needed.
The main difference is that the content of a routed navigation view is automatically created by the router.


```swift
struct TestProductsApp: App {
    
    @StateObject private var router = ProductsRouter()
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            // Replace:
            NavigationView {
              ProductsView()
            }
            // With:
            RoutedNavigationView(using: $router)
        }
    }
 }
 ```
 
 ### 5. Replace NavigationLink with RouteLink (Optional)

In cases where the destination of navigation links needs to be resolved dynamically at runtime, based on the current context of your app,
use a `RouteLink` instead of a `NavigationLink`. For any dynamic route you require create the appropriate view in the view composer. The way 
that `RouteLink` is implemented internally uses the native `NavigationLink` with the main difference between the two being that `RouteLink`
doesn't require that the destination to be defined at compile time.


```swift
struct ProductsView: View {
    @State private var products: [Product] = Product.previewProducts
    @State private var selection: Product?
    
    var body: some View {
        List {
            ForEach(products, id: \.self) { product in
                // If no dynamic view resolution is required, use NavigationLink.
                // It will work normally when placed within RoutedNavigationViews.
                NavigationLink(tag: product, selection: $selection) {
                    ProductDetailsView(productId: product.id)
                } label: {
                    Text(product.title)
                }
                
                // If dynamic view resolution is required, then use RouteLink.
                // The view can then be dynamically resolved at runtime by using
                // the provided View Composer.
                RouteLink(tag: product, selection: $selection, to: ProductRoutes.selectedProduct(productId: product.id)) {
                    Text(product.title)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## üß© Extension Points

The RouteLinkKit framework offers a possible extension point, that can help to modify the behaviour of the underlying UIKit UINavigationController. 
The class used in RouteLinkKit is a subclass of UINavigationController, specifically configured to be used with SwiftUI called `UIRoutingNavigationController` and
it's default behaviour can be easily modified by subclassing.

If more custom behaviour is required you can duplicate and modify the RoutedNavigationLink and RouteLink views, which by default only provide the 
functionality provided natively by SwiftUI.
